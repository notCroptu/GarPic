### Project Description

**GarPic** is a multiplayer mobile game where players take photos to visually represent secret words. In each round, all players receive the same word and must take a photo within a short time limit, if a player physically moves in the real world (with GPS), their timer is paused until they stop again, to encourage exploration.

Once all photos are submitted, players vote on which best represents the word and points are awarded based on votes, the number of rounds is based on the number of players, and a leaderboard is presented at the end of each session.

### Tech Decisions and Possibility Research

The project will use `UnityNetcode` for GameObjects to handle multiplayer communication, roles, points...

With a modular setup that supports LAN and Unity Relay hosting as taught in class to have private game sessions.

Creating this project for mobile would be the most feasible version of the game due to the need for free movement and use of a camera and GPS, but user given permission will also need to be given to the game and will be something else to explore later on.

#### Large Packets

To have a mobile version of the game, we would need a way to handle PNGs in the game.

To capture them is the simpler part, as we can use Unity's WebCamTexture to ask for camera feed. To send them from client to client however, we would need a way to handle large packets of data, for that the tool `UnityWebRequest` was found, used to upload images like the ones in the project to an external cloud, and then returning a link that can be passed to other clients using UnityNetcode for GameObjects.

#### Unity WebGL

Using WebGL was also considered, as it would people to play without requiring them to install anything, and while it would still need permission to access camera and gallery, it could potentially run on more platforms and devices.

However, capturing or selecting photos in a browser would require custom JavaScript to access the camera or gallery and convert the result into PNGs that could be uploaded using `UnityWebRequest`, and `UnityNetcode` for GameObjects cannot be used in `WebGL` builds, so multiplayer communication would need to rely on `WebSocket` (Unity plugin).

Testing the browser version would also be more complicated, as it would require uploading to an external host (GitHub or itch.io) rather than testing directly in the Unity Editor or local builds.

While the accessibility of a no-install was great, the limitations were too great for that single benefit, and as a result, the Unity Mobile version was chosen as the more practical option for development.

### Server Functions

The game would need to keep track of:

- The room or lobby of players;
- The roundâ€™s correct word;
- The image submitted by each player;
- Player scores;
- Broadcast messages;
- Rounds (What things need to be shown, images, votes, photo taking period);
- GPS movement (is moving or not, no need for location to be passed).

### Mobile Testing

For testing and debugging mobile input and gameplay during development, I first installed Unity Remote 5 on an Android device.

This video should explain the process:

![How to setup Unity Remote 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-48i5VclSc)

But otherwise the exact requirements would be:

- On an Android device running on Android 5.0 or later
  - **Unity Remote 5** app installed from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.mobileremote)
  - **Developer Mode** enabled:
    - Go to *Settings > About phone* and tap the Build number seven times ( also MIUI number or OS number)
  - **USB Debugging** enabled:
    - Go to *Settings > System > Developer options* and enable *USB debugging*
  - USB cable capable of data transfer
  - These **Unity Modules**:
    - Android Build Support
    - Android SDK & NDK Tools
    - OpenJDK

In Unity, in Editor Project Settings it would also be necessary for Device to be set to *"Any Android Device"*.

After this, on connecting the Android phone via USB to the computer running the Unity Editor allows the game view to stream directly to the device using Unity Remote 5.

#### Build, Install and Launch (.bat)

However, this setup only serves a way to debug input and rendering, and wouldn't reflect the device performance since it's still running from the editor, and some device inputs might still need to be built onto a mobile phone to reliable test them.

[Unity Remote 5](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote5.html)

For that reason, and to later use for testing in several phones at the same time, I had to create a Windows batch (.bat) script that would, after building, allow me to send an APK, install it, and run it on all USB Debugging connected devices to the PC.

ADB (Android Debug Bridge) came with the Unity Android Modules, though the adb short cut was not working even after inserting it into the PC Environment Variables, so for the script to work, one would need to install the unity module for the version used in the project (6000.0.30f1) or install ADB some other way and correct the path to adb.exe inside the .bat file.

[Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb#install)

A recurring problem was the automatization of this for multiple devices at the same time, as when there are multiple devices connected we need to specify which one to apply commands to, or it may cause `adb.exe: more than one device/emulator`.

This and the fact that batch does not include loop breaks or threading and GOTOs are tricky in loops and made the recessivity a bit hard to handle.

The script logic goes as follows:

- The script first uses` adb devices` to list all connected devices (USB).
- Loops through each found serial number.
- Runs connect/install/launch commands on specified targets.
- Disconnects all previous connections for cleanup.
